•	Allow doctors to review, edit, and create patient health records within appointment timeframes
•	Provide administrators with capabilities to manage users and approve doctor registrations
•	Enforce strict privacy controls including time-limited access to patient records (2-day post-appointment window)
•	Maintain audit trails for all medical record access and modifications
System Name: Healthcare Management System (HMS)
Benefits:
•	Improved patient engagement through flexible report submission
•	Enhanced privacy protection through time-limited access controls
•	Streamlined appointment and record management
•	HIPAA-compliant data handling
